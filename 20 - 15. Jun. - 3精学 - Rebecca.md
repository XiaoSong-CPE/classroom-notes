## Workflow

- Before Class
  - the phonics video of the last lesson vocabs is played. kids do their own things and not focus on it very much.
  - kids homeworks are being collected and all the graded workbooks collected last lesson are spreaded.
  - Rebecco roll calls kids by saying the name list and kids answer.
- <badge>12:00</badge> Review
  - Rebecco starts the vocabulary review by showing only the Chinese words first, and the children say the English equivalents, similar to an oral dictation.
  - all the vocabs are explain. Rebecca's examples for the vocabs are very interesting, like 'Rebecco is generous because I share homework with u' and 'Because Rebecco eats children! (roar like a tiger)'. (Rebecca's examples are so much fun! )
  - 'understood' is the past tense form of 'understand' is mentioned.
  - everyone read irregular verb list.
  - six min vocab dictation. kids can ask some difficuit questions (e.g. how to say 'quarrel') and Rebecco grades the early-finished dictation. all kids finished early and Rebecco start new dictaton about 2 min ealier.
  - irregular verbs dictation. during the two dictation, Rebecco grades the homework.
- <badge>12:20</badge> Grammar
  - Nina's turn.
  - see below
  - some practice. pick kids to answer and roll the dice.
  - role play (conversation). Rebecco leads kids go through all the words and sentences that will be used. roll dice to choose which sentence to be played (the effect is not very good with a really dice, because many kids can't see it very clearly and Rebecco can cheat easily. in this case, using the dice in ClassIn might be better).
  - Practice in LEW. Rebecco uses E book and Seewo note-taker. Many examples are give so kids know all the things they should notice. countdown is used to limit time cost. Check the answers.
  - Note-taking.
- <badge>13:20</badge> Workbooks
  - Rebecco gives kids some examples and gives some times to them for doing the practice.
- <badge>13:45</badge> Homework Check
- <badge>13:50</badge> Phonics
  - Rebecco leads kids read first
  - Rebecco plays the video and asks kids which words in the video do they hear that is with the phonics part learning today.
