## Workflow

- Before Class

  - **Breakfast**: Rick has breakfast.
  - **Homework Collection**: Pupils hand in their homework.

- Vocabulary Review

  - <badge>8:30</badge> **Reading**: Rick points to the words on the screen, and pupils read them aloud. Rick intervenes if pupils mispronounce any words. He dramatically mispronounces the same words to make the pupils laugh and help them remember the correct pronunciation.
  - <badge>8:35</badge> **Dictation**: Pupils complete their dictations while Rick grades their homework.

- New Article Learning
  - <badge>8:45</badge> **Introduction**: Rick introduces some geographical information and practices the phonics for some place names simultaneously. The pupils are excited to see content less related to English. (Compared to other teachers, Rick focuses a lot on phonics. Almost all the phonics of new place names are taught. This is beneficial because most of the place names are non-native English and challenging to pronounce, like the Sahara Desert and Burj Khalifa.)
  - <badge>9:05</badge> **Riddles**: A review of the place names just learned.
  - <badge>9:10 (including ten minutes recess)</badge> **Article**: Rick reads first, then guides the pupils through comprehension with simple questions. (Recess should be five minutes, but Rick returns five minutes late. It seems that the parents do not notice this.)
  - <badge>10:00 (including ten minutes recess)</badge> **Advanced Questions**: Rick starts with an easier question to help pupils solve the advanced ones. (Just like a complicated maths problem can be broken down into several small steps, an advanced question in an English class can be simplified into several easier questions. However, this method is akin to giving away the key problem-solving concept. It would be better if a similar question were provided to test whether the pupils fully understand the concept.)
- Homework Self-Grading
  - <badge>10:35</badge> **Reading Practice**: Pupils grade their homework.
  - <badge>10:45</badge> **Grammar Practice**: Pupils grade their homework.
- Others
  - Award the winning group.
  - Photograph the top pupils.

## Classroom Language

- ... we say?
  - In English, we say?
  - In Chinese, we say?
  - This word we say?
- Follow me
- Do you still remember ... (a word discussed just now)
- Uh-huh
- One more time
- Uh-uh

## Others

- Divide pupils into two groups and adjust points for the group with fewer members. (A teacher, I forget who it was, said fairness is very important to children, and I completely agree. In other teachers' classes, pupils sometimes complain that the groups have different numbers of members, and the teachers often ignore these complaints. However, Rick handles this well. Though it doesn't achieve absolute fairness, the pupils are content with it.)
- Standing up as a punishment.
- Recording the names of noisy pupils instead of deducting points directly. (But I haven't observed any consequences following the recording. If there are no consequences, this method won't be effective in the long run.)
- Sometimes, Rick mistakenly awards points, but no pupils notice. This is because Rick's two small toy dinosaurs, used for recording points, stand on the desk, making them difficult for pupils sitting behind to see. Additionally, the point-adding action is relatively discreet. In some other classes, pupils might shout if this happened. It should be avoided if possible.
- Hands up when ready. (As my notes from last week indicate, this causes the quickest pupils to keep their hands raised for too long. Sitting still when ready might be a better solution.)
- If pupils finish classwork, ask them to recite the article.
- '最垃圾的', '最菜的' make the pupils laugh.
