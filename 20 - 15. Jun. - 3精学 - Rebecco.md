# 20 - 15. Jun. - 3 精学 - Rebecco

## Workflow

- before class
  - play phonics video. kids do their own thing and not focus on it.
  - homework collection
  - Rebecco registers kids.
- 12:00 Review
  - Chinese only, kids say the words.
  - explain all the vocab. Much fun here. Rebecco makes many interesting sentences using the words. see 'others'.
  - 'understood' is the past tense form of 'understand' is mentioned.
  - everyone read irregular verb list.
  - six min vocab dictation. kids can ask some difficuit questions (e.g. how to say 'quarrel') and Rebecco grades the early-finished dictation. all kids finished early and Rebecco start new dictaton about 2 min ealier.
  - irregular verbs dictation. during the two dictation, Rebecco grades the homework.
- 12:20 Grammar
  - Nina's turn.
  - see below
  - some practice. pick kids to answer and roll the dice.
  - role play (conversation). Rebecco leads kids go through all the words and sentences that will be used. roll dice to choose which sentence to be played (the effect is not very good with a really dice, because many kids can't see it very clearly and Rebecco can cheat easily. in this case, using the dice in ClassIn might be better).
  - Practice in LEW. Rebecco uses E book and Seewo note-taker. Many examples are give so kids know all the things they should notice.
