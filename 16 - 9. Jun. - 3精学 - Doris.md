## Workflow

- **<badge>8:30</badge> Warm-up Song**

  - The lesson begins with a warm-up song to energize the children.

- **<badge>8:35</badge> Vocab Review**

  - Doris starts the vocabulary review by showing only the Chinese words first, and the children say the English equivalents, similar to an oral dictation.
  - The children then complete a written dictation.

- **<badge>8:40</badge> Vocab Learning**

  - Doris leads the children to 'read' the images.
  - Doris conducts a simple question and answer session to reinforce understanding.
  - Amy's turn (see below).
  - Doris uses flashcards for vocabulary review, showing the images first and encouraging the children to think and guess the vocabulary they just learned.
  - The session includes a 'wall clean' game to make learning interactive. (First, the game has a bug, which happened in all the classrooms I observed, that the pointer shows about 0.5 metres to the right of the clicked position. Secondly, the game has a scene that does not have a reason: why do we have to choose the correct cleaning tools to clean the dity wall? And the children are not as enthusiastic as in the other games played in Doris' classroom).

- **<badge>9:15</badge> Article Learning**

  - The children listen to an audio recording of the article.
  - They read the article alone and then recite it.
  - The children read along with the audio.
  - An instant recitation game involves rolling dice to determine how many points will be added for a successful recitation.

- **<badge>10:00</badge> Practice**
  - Listening Practice: If the audio plays twice, Doris grades the children who finish earlier.

- Amy is very familiar with the slides, which makes her confident.
- Amy's spoken English is fluent and natural.
