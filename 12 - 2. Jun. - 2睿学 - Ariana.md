## Workflow
- <badge>15:00</badge> Vocabulary Review
  - **Fill-in sentences**: Same as Icey's method, but stars (points) are awarded to groups.
  - **Number & vocab**: Same as Icey's method, but a video is recorded simultaneously.
  - **Dictation**
- <badge>15:15</badge> New article
  - **Intro images**: Introduce fast food and review countable and uncountable nouns.
  - **Missing game**: Same as Icey's method. The group with the correct answer sends one child to throw a ball. If the ball hits the five-star target, the group earns five stars.
  - **Images and inspiring questions**: Discuss without seeing the text.
  - Ariana reads and explains complicated words and grammar first, then asks children to read group by group.
  - **Watch article video**
  - **Advanced questions**
- <badge>16:40</badge> Homework self-grading

## Classroom Language
- Focus here
- (When an acceptable answer is given) That is right; (when a better answer is given) That is better

## Others
- Hand up if children have finished.
- Ariana's memory is very good. She adds points after a section of activity ends, preventing frequent interruptions.
- For special activities, children might be divided into groups that differ from the competition groups. This can cause confusion and be unfair to the original competition groups. For example, in this class, Ariana says "apple pie," and the specified group members say "an apple pie," without necessarily creating brand-new group divisions.
- Stars (points) are too large and numerous, filling the screen by halfway through the class. This increases the likelihood of accidental removal, addition, and miscounting.
- When children have conflicts, Ariana only says "stop" and tries to address the issue after class. While this avoids wasting class time, it could negatively affect the children's mood.
- Ariana prefer to use 'RMB' instead of 'China yuan', which is not very good, because in oral English 'China yuan' is more frequent used.
