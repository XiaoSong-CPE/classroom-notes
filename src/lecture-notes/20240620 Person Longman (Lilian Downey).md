### Grammar translation method

e.g. 新概念英语

- give tons of examples and let kids find the patterns.
- purely writing
- kids learn about the lang system not the use of lang 

### Audio-Lingua Approch

e.g. 英语 上海教育出版社

- kids learn vocabulary
- kids imitate / watch; teachers act, kids identify
- it focuses on listening and speaking
- target patterns are unnatural with little or no real meaning involved

### Communicative Lang Teaching

teaching lang in a situation for communication

=> to give a reasonable situation of the teaching sentences

e.g. longman textbook: a leg-broken boy ask a girl what can she see outside the window.
