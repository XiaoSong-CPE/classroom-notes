## Methods

### Grammar Translation Method

e.g. 新概念英语

- Provide numerous examples and let children identify patterns.
- Focus solely on writing.
- Children learn about the language system, not its practical use.

### Audio-Lingual Approach

e.g. 英语 上海教育出版社

- Children learn vocabulary.
- Children imitate and watch; teachers act, and children identify.
- Emphasises listening and speaking.
- Target patterns are unnatural with little or no real meaning.

### Communicative Language Teaching

- Teach language in a communicative context.
- Provide a realistic context for the teaching sentences (e.g. a boy with a broken leg asks a girl what she can see outside the window).

### Task-Based Teaching

- Features: Context, Purpose, Process, Product, Skills & Knowledge

  - Don't read directly. Try to engage children first.
  - While-reading stage: Read for gist and supporting details.
    - First reading: Summarise the gadget.
    - Second reading: Details.
    - Post-reading: Observe and extend learning.

## My Thoughts

Lilian explains the history, theory, and practical examples of modern language teaching.

Regarding the historical aspect, it's unfortunate that Lilian didn't have time to explain why the new methods are superior. For instance, the Grammar Translation Method is still used when teaching specific grammar points for the first time. Although we don’t use this method exclusively, many of its concepts remain relevant. Why, then, is it considered outdated? Lilian briefly mentioned that it only helps students learn about the language system, not its practical use. While this reason is intuitive, the lecture lacks detailed comparisons and experiments, which I am curious about.

In terms of practical examples, Lilian demonstrates how to create a complete task-based teaching activity. I found this very informative and now know what constitutes a comprehensive task section in my teaching.
