    - Talking: Ask children to share the exciting things with everyone; change seats
    - Fidgeting: Ask children to put unrelated items away
    - Writing slowly: Ask children for the reason; spend some time with them after class; set time limits and reward fast children
    - Feeling sleepy: Allow children to sleep during recess; ask them to do previews; send recordings to parents
    - Cheating: For those who didn’t review, let them redo the exam; for those aiming for high scores, emphasise the importance of honesty
    - Lack of interest in learning: Talk to the children; discuss with parents
    - Wanting to express: No immediate reaction; assign additional oral video recording homework
