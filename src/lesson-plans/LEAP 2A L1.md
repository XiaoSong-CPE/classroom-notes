    > Here are some ideas.

- Phonics
  - Ask children to give more examples including the learned phonics parts `pl` and `cl`.

- Homework

## Others

- For game rules, provide fewer explanations and more examples.
- Clap softly, otherwise, children can’t hear clearly.
- Little teacher - point to the text.
- Take any opportunity to say the teacher’s name so children can remember it.
- 'Take out your textbook' (show the book at the same time).
