# 11 - 2. Jun. - 2精学 - Icey

## Workflow
- <badge>12:30</badge> Vocabulary Review
  - **Fill in sentences**
  - **Read words**: Children read the words first, then Icey provides brief information and extended quizzes (e.g., weekend => weekday, different => same). If a child doesn't know, Icey gives the sound of the first syllable as a hint.
  - **Number & vocab**: Icey says a number, and the children say the vocabulary word associated with that number.
  - **Dictation**: When finished, the children hand in their dictation sheets to Icey.
- <badge>12:45</badge> Phonics review
  - **Quick review**
  - **120-second pair work**: Two (or one) minutes for children to prepare. Using the learnt communication structures ("Where do you want to go?" and "What do you want to do"), they ask and answer. If everyone completes it quickly and the total time is less than 2 minutes (1.5 minutes), every pair gets the chance to choose a red packet. Record a video for parents and for timing.
  - **Simple practice**
- <badge>13:00</badge> Phonics
  - **Music video**
    - Listen, Icey reads, children repeat, and then sing together with 'll' sound, clapping hands.
  - **Notetaking**
  - **Phonics practice**

## Quick Response
- Fill in sentences: When reading the blank, children stand up and answer the question.

## Classroom Language
- One, two, three! - A, B, C!
- Let's look at the questions one by one.

## Other
- Classroom competition is similar to Miriam's. Add a point to Icey if both groups misbehave.
- **Red packet draw**: Paper, scissors, rock; the winner in each pair gets the chance to choose a red packet.
- Two points for a good answer, one point for a teacher-hinted answer.
- Record videos often for conversation practice, singing, etc.
- Extended vocabulary information: synonyms, antonyms, among others.
- Every child has a notebook. Icey takes notes on the screen and the children copy them into their notebooks. (By the way, it's quite scary to see red notes on a black background, especially with so many handwritten 'l's that look like dripping blood.)

- "There" and "their": Icey asks, "Are they the same?" and the children answer, "No." Actually, Icey wants to ask, "Do they sound the same?" These two questions are different.
- At recess, no cartoons. Icey grades in-class practice.
- Icey patrols while the children practice.
