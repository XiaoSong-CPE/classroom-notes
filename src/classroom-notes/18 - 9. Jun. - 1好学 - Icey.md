# 18 - 9. Jun. - 1好学 - Icey

## Workflow

- **<badge>15:00</badge> Vocab Review**

  - Quick response review.
  - Icey reads the vocabulary words and their phonics aloud while the children write them down.

- **<badge>15:10</badge> Warm-Up**

  - Song: _What Do You Like to Do?_: Introduces actions such as 'ride a bike', 'watch TV', 'read a book', 'swim', etc. After watching once, Icey asks the children to recall and say the actions mentioned in the song.

- **<badge>15:15</badge> Article Review**

  - The children read the article with blanks on the screen together. When they encounter a blank, they stand up and say the word aloud.

- **<badge>15:20</badge> Grammar**

  - Review of the grammar from the last lesson ('What are you doing?').
  - Icey leads the children to read images and asks simple questions.
  - **Note-Taking**: Every child has a notebook. Icey prepares notes for the children to copy into their notebooks. Children who finish note-taking early read the notes aloud. Icey checks the children's note-taking. After note-taking, everyone reads the notes aloud together.
  - **PK**: The group that reads all the images the fastest wins. A video is recorded for each group for the children’s parents and for timing. The winning group gets to choose a random red packet with points inside. (the red pocket choosing is based on slides and cause many unconveniences, like accidentally move to next or previous slide. It's better using a certain application instead of slides.)
  - **Work in Pairs**: The children have a conversation with each other. One child asks, 'What is he/she/it/they doing?' and the other answers, 'He/she/it/they is/are v-ing.'

- **<badge>16:25</badge> Practice**

  - The children complete their practice exercises. A countdown is used to limit the time. Children who finish early are graded by Icey immediately.
  - The children self-grade their work.
  - If the children do not know how to proceed, they can ask Icey for help.

- **<badge>16:55</badge> Other Activities**
  - Icey assigns homework and explains how to do it.
  - Icey quickly checks the homework, only checks if it is completed, not if it is correct.
  - Icey takes photos of the top-performing children.
  - Icey rewards the members of the winning group.

## Quick Response

- Icey points to a word randomly, and the children say it.

## Classroom Language

- Hand in your books, children. Hurry up.
- Let's have a PK.

## Other Notes

- Play the warm-up video during recess.
- When children are very lazy and unwilling to cooperate, Icey asks all of them to stand up.
- Threaten children with detention so they behave well.
- The vowels a, e, i, o, u together form a face.
