## Workflow

- Before class
  - **Homework collection**: Miriam asks the children to hand in their homework from time to time.
  - **Reward presentation**: Miriam shows the reward for the winning group—biscuits. (Miriam shows the box of biscuits, but the children are not as excited as expected. Some children prefer toys. Considering Miriam used to have toys for the children, it might be better to offer both toys and biscuits. Additionally, the box isn't very appealing. It might be better to display the biscuits directly instead of the box.)
  - **Children's Day performance**: Some children sing and dance, and Miriam encourages them to participate in a Children's Day performance. The children are very excited and many are willing to participate. Although they don't ask for it, Miriam announces that those who perform will receive a bag of biscuits.
- <badge>12:30</badge> Vocabulary review
  - **Quick quiz**: The children see pictures and say the associated words or fill in the blanks in simple sentences.
  - **Dictation**: Miriam says the words and their phonics, and the children write them down. (Since the children are in Primary 1, they are not very good at phonics. Miriam seizes every opportunity to help them learn phonics.)
- New vocabulary
  - **Intro video**: _Action verbs_: Introduce 'stand', 'walk', 'waddle', 'stomp', 'run', and 'jump'. (Although I don't think this video is of high quality—no rhythm, no puns, no jokes—it still captures the children's attention. Videos are indeed very engaging. However, a higher quality video, like another one used in this class, would be even better.)
  - **Pictures, words, and phonics**
  - **Bomb or Star**: (see below)
  - **翻牌打地鼠**: Similar to Doris' class but with a quick response to pick children, playing until all the cards are matched.

- <badge>13:10</badge> Reading
  - **First reading**: Showing the comic strips in the textbook, allowing children to guess the story of the reading passage. Miriam asks simple questions.
  - 10-minute recess (cartoon, top kids photo-taking)
  - **Second reading**: Listening to the whole article. Children underline key phrases and familiarise themselves with them. Miriam takes notes on the screen and the children copy them.
  - **Third reading**: Advanced questions. Similar to Rick's approach, Miriam starts with easier questions to help the pupils tackle the more advanced ones.
- <badge>14:00</badge> Practice
  - **Method explanation**: Miriam explains the method to solve the questions.
  - **Practice**: The children work quietly.
  - **Grading**: Miriam patrols and checks completed work, assessing pronunciation at the same time by asking the children to read aloud.
- <badge>14:20</badge> Exam preparation
  - **Quick Q&A**: Miriam presents some simple questions and the children answer them quickly. (It appears these questions have been covered in previous classes, so the children can respond quickly.)
- <badge>14:25</badge> Ending
  - **Counting points**
  - **Rewarding**
  - **Photo**

## Quick Response

- Number and word matching
  - Phase 1: Miriam says a number, children say the word.

  - Phase 2: Miriam says a number, children say the word, but the words next to a bomb should not be said. If a child says it, the other group gets a point and everyone else says to them, 'One, two, bomb!' (Last week, I saw a similar quick response game, but without the bomb. The bombs make it much more fun.)

- Soft sound and loud sound switching phonics and words
- Miriam says 'One, two, three, banana' and the children stand up and say 'Miriam'. Miriam might say other fruits as a trap.

## Others

- Children notice wrongly added points
- Miriam joins the race. If children misbehave, Miriam gets one point.
- No Chinese. If children speak in Chinese, they will be warned. (Although this rule is probably intended to help children learn English faster, a side effect is that it prevents them from talking about class-irrelevant things, which is often done in Chinese.)
- When asking children to help, if other children offer to help too, they will be asked to help next time.
- M [clap] a_e [clap] k [clap] make [clap]
- Paper, scissors, rock to decide the order
- 抽奖: Bomb or Star (Choose a word, read it correctly and see if it’s a star or a bomb. Stars add points and bombs give a point to the other group.)

- The children have booklets specifically for collecting and spending points.
