  - Rebecca patrols and grades the completed dictations.

- <badge>15:20</badge> **Reading**

  - A brief look at the pictures in the reading sheet.
  - The children listen to the audio together.
  - Rebecca leads the children in reading the story and taking notes on the screen, which they should write down on their reading sheet. (Rebecca doesn’t explicitly tell the children to copy the notes, so some don’t follow until it is mentioned.)
  - Advanced questions.

- <badge>16:15</badge> **Phonics**

  - The children watch the first video and then discuss which words in the video include the 'u' sound.
  - They listen to a song for the first time and then sing it together the second time. Rebecca also asks which words in the song include the 'u' sound.
  - They add more 'u' sound words to the LEW. Rebecca takes notes on the screen for the children to copy.
  - They read the phonics practice sentences together, clapping or stamping for each 'u' sound. First, they do it together, then group by group.
  - They listen to a song about double 'p' when adding 'ing'. They listen first and then Rebecca leads them in singing.
