## Workflow

- **Before Class**

  - Miriam asks the children to hand in their homework.

- **<badge>9:00</badge> Vocab Review**

  - Miriam uses flashcards for the children to review vocabulary learnt in the last lesson. The children say the vocabulary words corresponding to the images on the flashcards. (Unlike other teachers who do not use flashcards for reviewing, the images on Miriam’s flashcards are much more effective in helping the children remember vocabulary, especially nouns.)
  - **Dictation**: Miriam says the words and their phonics, and the children write them down. (Since the children are in Primary 1, they are not very proficient with phonics. Miriam takes every opportunity to help them become more familiar with phonics.)

- **<badge>9:15</badge> Vocab Learning (Action Words)**

  - Miriam asks the children to share the verbs they know. A child who gives a reasonable answer earns one point for their group. (One child gave more than one reasonable verb but only received one point, which seemed unfair. To maintain balance, it might be better to give the first child two points and clearly state that multiple answers from one child are not allowed in the future.)
  - Miriam shows a music video of action words. All the children stand up and perform the actions shown in the video. Miriam awards five points to each group for good behaviour. (Some children do not actively participate, not because they are unwilling, but because they do not know how to act. This is especially true for children farther away from Miriam, who may have struggled to see and follow her actions clearly when everyone is standing.)

- **<badge>9:20</badge> Article Review**

  - The children read a passage with blanks. When they reach a blank, they stand up and read out the correct answer. Miriam awards points to each group as they all perform well.

- **<badge>9:25</badge> Grammar Learning**

  - Miriam leads the children to 'read' the images.
  - Miriam introduces grammar concepts primarily in English, with some Chinese for clarification.
  - Both English and Chinese jingles are used to help the children remember grammar concepts. (In this section, Chinese is used a bit too much, especially considering that in Miriam's class, speaking Chinese is usually strictly prohibited.)
  - Everyone repeats the grammar knowledge jingles, both the English and Chinese ones, during practice.

- **<badge>10:00</badge> Board Game**

  - Miriam introduces the rules of the board game.
  - Before the game, Miriam helps the children become familiar with the words that will be used in the game.
  - The children play the board game with their partners.

- **<badge>10:35</badge> Practice**

  - Miriam explains how to do the practice exercises.
  - Children who are unsure can ask Miriam for help.
  - The children complete the practice exercises independently.

- **<badge>10:55</badge> Other Activities**
  - Miriam and the children count the final points of the two groups.
  - Miriam rewards all the members of the winning group.
  - Miriam takes photos of the top-performing children.

## Quick Response

- **Number & Word Matching**

  - **Variety 1**: Miriam says a number, and the children say the corresponding word.
  - **Variety 2**: Miriam says a number, and the children say the word, but words next to a bomb should not be said. If a child says it, the other group gets a point, and everyone says to them, 'One, two, bomb!'
  - **Variety 3**: Miriam says a number, and the children say the word, but words next to an apple should be said twice.

- **One, Two, Three, Banana**
  - Miriam says 'one, two, three, banana', and the children stand up and say 'Miriam'. The fastest child is chosen for games or quizzes. Sometimes, there is no 'banana', and if the children respond, it doesn't count.

## Classroom Language

- Are you ready? - Go!
- Good morning, everyone - Good morning, Miriam.
- Bye-bye ... hello ... (meaning to remove something and add something else)
- Sit nicely.
- Let's play a game.
- Show me, show me.
- Everybody listen.

## Gestures and Facial Expressions

- **Skipping**: Jump a little bit, hands as if holding a skipping rope.

## Other Notes

- Miriam joins the race. If the children misbehave, Miriam gets one point. (This is also used in other teachers' classrooms. However, Miriam's points are too few and don’t have much effect on the children. Since there aren’t many opportunities for adding Miriam’s points, it might be better to award five or more points each time, which makes the children behave better almost immediately, as observed in other teachers' classrooms.)
- Miriam prepares extra papers, pens, worksheets, etc., in case any child forgets to bring them.
- No Chinese is allowed. If children speak in Chinese, they will be warned. (Although this rule is probably intended to help children learn English faster, a side effect is that it prevents them from discussing class-irrelevant topics, which is often done in Chinese.)
- Miriam dramatically repeats mispronounced or incorrect responses, making the children laugh and remember the correct pronunciations or responses.
- Miriam speaks louder to cover the children's noise and attract their attention.
- Children roll dice to choose which question they should answer. (This is very interesting. However, repetitive numbers being rolled frequently by the fourth or fifth round waste a lot of time. Having learnt programming, I might develop an application for such child-choosing mechanics if I have free time.)
