## Workflow

1. Vocabulary Review

   1. Read Together: Doris and the children read the words together simultaneously. (This saves time compared to 'read after'. I'm not sure if there are other differences.)
   2. Word Performances: Doris performs a short play for each mispronounced word. (Compared to Yuki's performances, Doris's are more vivid, well-prepared, and also time-consuming. Firstly, Doris's performances are more vivid, detailed, and interactive. For instance, Doris acts out an 'interview' by using a real microphone toy and asking a child some interview questions. While Yuki might (though she doesn't have the same word in her Primary One class) perform the same word by pretending to hold a microphone and saying, 'Hello, I'm reporter Yuki. May I interview you?' and no more. Secondly, Doris's performances are more well-prepared. Using the previous example, Doris has a real microphone toy in the classroom and many other props. Since Doris and Yuki's performance skills are at the same level, it's much better to include these little props. Thirdly, Doris's performances are much more time-consuming. The previous interview example took around 30 seconds, whereas a typical word performance by Yuki lasts about 10 seconds. So Doris only performs for words mispronounced by children to deepen their memory, while Yuki performs almost everything to keep the attention of Primary One children every 10 seconds. I'm not sure if this difference is due to the age difference of the children or the teaching styles of the two teachers.)
   3. Dictation

2. New Vocabulary

   1. Lead-in: Doris explains the new words. (However, the children already know so much that they understand all the lead-in sentences, and Doris doesn't have a chance to 'lead'.)
   2. Simple Q&A: Doris asks easy questions, and the children answer. (Similar to the lead-in, the children already know everything. Doris says, 'You are the teachers. You teach me!')
   3. Little Teacher: Doris selects some children to stand in front of the classroom and lead everyone else in reading the lead-in sentences. (I'm not sure if this was the original plan or if Doris adjusted the plan because she praised the children for being so smart that they could be teachers. If it's the latter, Doris reacts and adjusts the plans very quickly and effectively.)

3. New Article

   1. Listening: Children listen to the audio. (Some other teachers may ask children to point to the currently read sentence to ensure everybody is focusing.)
   2. Telling: Doris tells the story. (Doris's voice fluctuates suddenly between loud and soft. Is this a way to attract the children's attention? I don't particularly like this. The sudden loud sounds do grab my attention, but the soft sounds are hard to hear clearly because I've already become accustomed to the loud sounds. The sudden loud sounds happen especially when Doris expresses surprise, which is a bit jarring to me. Perhaps the children have already gotten used to it.)
   3. Simple Q&A: Doris asks easy questions, and the children answer. (Basically the same as Yuki and almost every other teachers.)

## Other Notes

- Enlarge the award icons when there are only a few icons.
- Props: Interview microphone, Handy, Long teaching stick, Short chalkboard pen.
- Everything is backed up: Pens, pencils, notebooks, workbooks, etc. (I definitely agree with this practice, and Doris's preparation helps many children follow the lesson. But nothing is perfect, and the likelihood of children forgetting something is relatively high in Doris's class. However, it's much better to have the forgetting child share books and pens with others or simply follow along without books and pens.)
- Remove award icons if children behave poorly. (Doris really likes to remove points. I can't believe almost half of the points are removed due to bad behaviour in each group. Most modern video games try to avoid causing too many losses for players. In the game Identity V, for example, players won't lose anything they've obtained once, and all losable things are limited to the unlimited replayable game turns. Modern games try to avoid players' losses, and they must have their own reasons. If it were me, I might add points for another group as a punishment for the poorly behaved group.)
- Line up the children and have them work together on a matching game on the chalkboard.

- Perform 'Jump the Queue': Pick three children to join the performance. Children are well-mannered people lining up and waiting at the bus stop, while Doris jumps the queue by walking in a hurry and pushing the other people. (This is a great short play. Even though the three children do practically nothing, they join the play and have fun.)
- Doris's patience seems unlimited. When a child gives a wrong answer, Doris gives them many chances to correct it, sometimes without hints. For example, if a child cannot pronounce the stress in 'comfortable' correctly, after multiple attempts without hints, the mistake remains. Perhaps Doris thinks there are only three syllables in 'comfortable', so this is not a free-answer question but a multiple-choice question. However, the child doesn't fully understand the concept of stress, so it's still a free-answer question. In my opinion, if a child cannot answer correctly after three tries, it's very possible that they genuinely don't know the answer instead of simply giving the wrong answer or mispronouncing it accidentally. In these cases, hints or the correct answer should be provided.
