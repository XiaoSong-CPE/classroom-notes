Others
* Thanks S if they helped (~making S useful and helpful can reduce L task. Thanks cannot be forgot when one is used to the helping.~)
* Do phonics first for new or wrongly pronounced words (~Get familiar with the sound, as a practice of phonics. Then explain the meaning, using English to explain first, and then ask S to guess the meaning, if S cannot guess the correct answer, Chinese follows.~)
* Mark deviders for phonics (~looks like they are devided by syllibals. Quite useful when the word is long~)
* Repeat the question slowy if S doesn't give response (~if S is lost, give a chance for them to follow up~)
* when u ready, sit still (~This might be better than raise hands, which is observed by me in the previous lesson. Otherwise the quikest S have to raise theri hands for a long time~)
* two points for good answer; one point for rectified answer. (~This is common used. To generalised the concept, it reqiures L to praise two points for good S while find reasons to encourage the others~)
* patrol from time to time (~Check if S turn to the correct page or if they finish the writing work. I don't like this when I was a kid, for that I may not doing the in-class works. This might cause conflict.~)
