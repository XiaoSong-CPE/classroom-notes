# 25 May - 精学 - Yuki

## Workflow

1. Phonics (1)
   1. Review: Children read after Yuki.
   2. Charades: Yuki performs, and the children guess the word. (It seems the children have learned these words before. These words help with learning phonics, but the children are not required to remember them. Charades quickly remind the children of the words' meanings and make the review more enjoyable.)
2. Story
   1. Telling: Yuki tells the story. (Yuki's performance is impressively natural and fluent, like watching a real play.)
   2. Simple Q&A: Yuki asks easy questions, and the children answer. (Simply telling the story might cause some children to ignore the text. This section aims to improve the children’s reading skills. Simple Q&A keeps the children focused on the text.)
   3. Reading: Children read after the audio.
   4. Advanced Q&A: Yuki asks more challenging questions and gives hints through charades or by introducing new knowledge directly. (In this section, words like 'play' and 'character' are introduced as extended knowledge. I find Yuki's hints too broad, leading the children to guess through luck. For example, when Yuki says, 'characters are the people in a play', children might guess 'princess' or 'king' instead of the correct answer '角色'. When I was learning German, I used an app called Duolingo that provided similar questions but offered multiple-choice options instead of random guessing. I think Duolingo's approach is better and could be easily integrated into the class with a single slide displaying the options.)
3. Video
4. Phonics (2)
   1. New phonics
5. Practice
   1. Listening practice: Children listen first, then Yuki explains interactively. (Some teachers show the text of the listening material, making it easier to explain. When I was young, I felt it was unfair when teachers showed the text because it seemed they didn’t listen to the audio. Both approaches have their benefits and drawbacks.)
   2. Integrated practice: Yuki explains the method first, then the children practise on their own. (Yuki often tells us to explain the method first to reduce mistakes and save time grading. I don’t fully agree with this reasoning, but in-class practice like this does need to save time, as there is often little time left in the lesson.)

## Classroom Language

- To ask children to be quiet or focus:
  - Yuki: One, two, three.
  - Children: A, B, C.
- To read together:
  - Ready, go!

## Quick Response

- 'I say three, you raise your hands' 'One, two... (pause suddenly, or say different numbers, then continue)...three!'
- [phonic] [clap], [phonic] [clap], [word] [stomp]. (with rhythm)

## Common Gestures

- Silent / shh / be quiet: Small sound.
- Run: Swing arms.
- Smile / long 'i' sound: Smile and make a circle gesture with hands.
- Cough: Cough.
- Read: One hand holds an imaginary book, the other turns pages.
- Can you tell me: Raise hand and shake.
- Yummy / eat / (food): 'NOM NOM NOM'; one hand holds an imaginary bowl, the other uses a spoon.
- You try: Hand facing up, point to children.
- Smell: Sniff, holding an imaginary substance and wafting the air towards your nose like a chemist.
- Where: Look far, hand at forehead.
- Let me see: Look far, hands at eyes like binoculars.
- Sad: Sad expression; pouting.
- Talk: Hands gesture like a mouth; 'blablabla'.
- Best: Thumbs up.
- I can't hear you / what: Hand by ear, listening gesture.
- Long ears: Hands extended as long ears.
- Angry: Hands on hips, angry expression.
- Short: Fingers show a small distance, about 5 cm apart.
- Long: Arms stretched wide, about 150 cm apart.

## Other Notes

- Thank the children if they help. (Making children feel useful and helpful can reduce the teacher's workload, even if just a little. Always remember to thank them.)
- Start with phonics for new or mispronounced words. (Get familiar with the sound as phonics practice, then explain the meaning. Use English first and ask the children to guess. If they can't, provide the Chinese translation.)
- Mark syllable divisions for phonics. (This is helpful, especially for long words.)
- Repeat the question slowly if the children don’t respond. (If children are lost, give them a chance to catch up. Yuki may simplify the questions for those who are struggling, which should be done if possible. A successful answer can boost their confidence for the rest of the lesson.)
- When ready, sit still. (This might be better than raising hands, which is common in other lessons. Otherwise, the quickest children have to keep their hands raised for too long.)
- Two points for a correct answer; one point for a corrected answer. (This is commonly used. To generalise this concept, teachers should praise the good children and find reasons to encourage the others.)
- Patrol the classroom regularly. (Check if the children are on the correct page or have finished their work or note-taking. As a child, I didn’t like this because I often wasn’t doing my classwork, which could lead to conflict.)
