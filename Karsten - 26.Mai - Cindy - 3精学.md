## Quike Response

- antonym response (must vs. mustn't)
- 抢答 ('ding' using a ring)
- ready? / go!

## Other
- if kids are noisy, speak louder to cover their voice or knock the teaching stick
- adv. is v.'s best friend
- dialog for one point and action for another point. (Cindy didn't examplified the action very clearly. Kids made dialogs without actions many times and Cindy didn't realise the example is not clear enough and continue the same poor   example. Doris did this much better.)
- stand-up as punishment
- provide Chinese for new words directly (if kids already guess the Chinese out)
- differ from Doris, Cindy rectify pronouciation immediatly after kids making oral mistakes. (I think it's OK to give kids a second chance because they might be nervous or know the correct pronounce but say that in wrong way accidentally. Doris gives too many chance for kids and i think it's unneccesory. For most of the time, if kids could not answer correctly in the first two or three turns, they realy dont know or have forgoten so remind them at this time is proper and can save time)
- let kids who forget taking workbook write on blank papers according to the questions displayed on the chalkboard. (nice. so why do we need a paper one?)
- remind to turn off e-devices when they make sounds. minus points if this happen again.
