Notes are devided into two parts, red and yellow ones (basicly the yellow ones are chinese explaination). red notes is what kids must write down while yellow ones is optional. kids like talking wihle taking notes. Coco takes photos of the notes. Countdown is used to limit the time cost. when countdown is over, Coco asks kids who finished raise their hands and add points for all-finished group. the points depend one the dice rolling. to be quick Coco rolls the dice directly but she roll continuasly untill kids say 'stop'.
